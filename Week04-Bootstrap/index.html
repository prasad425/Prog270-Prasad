        <h1>Welcome to GnomeWare!</h1>
        <h2>What is GnomeWare?</h2>
        <p>Of course, gnomeware is the same as software, but it is used by gnomes instead of non-gnomes.  With software, gnomes are able to achieve better results than non-gnomes. How?  Because they are gnomes!</p>
        <h2>Benefits of being a gnome (also known as gnomefits)</h2>
        <p>As some may have realized by now, being a gnome comes with several benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A small stature allows gnomes to squeeze into tight spaces. This advantage allows the gnome to better explore the world for treasure and evade trouble.</li>
            <li>Gnomes are highly charismatic and thus able to charm their way towards their heart's desire. This charisma also lets the gnome escape trouble when it isn't possible to squeeze out of it!</li>
            <li>The gnome is a master at magic craft. She may wield mightily a spell more than a knight wields the sword, indeed!</li>
            <li>Curiosity and intellect are the cornerstones of the gnomes' culture and being. These traits cause the gnomes to become evermore advantageous in their pursuits!</li>
            <li>Gnomes are creative, long-living, and very social beings whom get along well with just about anyone. They also prefer to sustain and protect nature.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Gnomish Software</h2>
        <p>The gnomes use spells and magic to create software and their software may process more than just information in computers. In fact, gnomeware may be used to directly process actual matter and energy in space-time. Luckily, only the friendly and nature-loving gnomes possess the keys to such powerful tools! </p>
